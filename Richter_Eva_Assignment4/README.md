### Word-Alignments

This is the fourth assignment from the **computational linguistics** lecture at **Saarland University** during the **WS 2021/21**. In this assignment a word aligner was implemented, which is an essential task for statistical machine translation systems. Given a pair of aligned sentences in English-French, the source words were aligned to their target translations. An aligner based on IBM Model 1 was implemented to improve over the baseline. Furthermore, an off-the-shelf aligner was implemented. My IBM Model 1 was compared to the implementation of Model 1 in the off-the-shelf aligner *Fast Align*, the results of which are presented in the results.pdf file.
