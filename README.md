# ðŸ“˜ Computational Linguistics Assignments (WS 2021/22)

This repository contains my solutions for **Assignments 1â€“4** from the *Computational Linguistics* course at **Saarland University** in the winter term 2021/22.  
Each assignment focused on implementing core NLP and computational linguistics concepts in Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Assignments

### 1. Zipf's Law & Random Text Generation  
- Analyzed word frequency distributions in corpora.  
- Implemented simple random text generation to illustrate Zipfâ€™s law in practice.  

### 2. POS Tagging with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)  
- Implemented a POS tagger using a Hidden Markov Model.  
- Applied the Viterbi algorithm for sequence decoding.  

### 3. CFGs & CKY Parsing  
- Worked with context-free grammars (CFGs).  
- Implemented the **CKY algorithm** to parse sentences based on CFG rules.  

### 4. Word Alignments (IBM Model 1)  
- Implemented a simple alignment model for bilingual sentence pairs.  
- Based on **IBM Model 1** for statistical machine translation.
