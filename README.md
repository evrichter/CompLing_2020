# ðŸ“˜ Computational Linguistics Assignments (WS 2021/22)  

This repository contains my solutions for **Assignments 1â€“4** from the *Computational Linguistics* course at **Saarland University** in the winter term 2021/22.  
Each assignment focused on implementing fundamental concepts of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computational Linguistics** in Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Assignments  

### 1. Zipf's Law & Random Text Generation  
- Analyzed word frequency distributions in corpora and verified **Zipfâ€™s Law**.  
- Implemented random text generation using **n-gram language models**.  

### 2. POS Tagging with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)  
- Implemented a **POS tagger** using a Hidden Markov Model.  
- Applied the **Viterbi algorithm** for sequence decoding.  

### 3. CFGs & CKY Parsing  
- Worked with **context-free grammars (CFGs)**.  
- Implemented the **CKY algorithm** for bottom-up parsing.  

### 4. Word Alignments (IBM Model 1)  
- Implemented a **word alignment model** for bilingual sentence pairs.  
- Compared a custom **IBM Model 1** implementation with the off-the-shelf aligner **Fast Align**.
